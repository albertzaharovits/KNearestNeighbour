K Nearest Neighbour with False Nearest Neighbour

Albert Zaharovits albert.zaharovits@gmail.com

Predictor method for chaotic scalar data series, using the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm
for regression

False Nearest Neighbour - outputs the minimum embeddind dimensions for which 
the attractor can be traced
K Nearest Neighbour - using the output from the Nearest Neighbour computes the weighted
average of the K closest neighbours in the delay space; 

predictor1 - outputs the next predicted value in the data series
predictor2 - calls predictor1 succesively for multi-values predictions

sun_spot.txt - test input data, half the series can be the <<<train>>> data and the other
half could be the reference for the predicted series; the embedding dimension (output 
of False Nearest Neighbour) should be 4.

mean_square_error - can be used to aproximate the error between the predicted values and the reference
